# The Tech Blog

  ## Description

  
   I wanted to be able to create a full stack application from scratch to better under stand how the backend and front end meet together to be able to display to a user a blog that enables them to create a user profile and create new posts and see other users posts. This will help with not having only just a landing page of html and css but rather able to also use a server to help with using created Api's for the user to access.
   Seeing the fullstack development of this application shows how useful it is to have the support of a backend server but also the designs on the front end in order to make websites or application much more user friendly.
